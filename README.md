# Upshot

**WARNING: THIS IS NOT MERELY EXPERIMENTAL. IT IS REALLY MOST SINCERELY EXPERIMENTAL!**

A [Seesaw](https://github.com/daveray/seesaw) style Clojure API for [JavaFX](http://javafx.com).

## Usage
JavaFX is included in latest Oracle JDK, so you only have to install dependencies as usual:

    lein deps

In case JavaFX is not included in your JDK (older version, OpenJDK...), you'll need to install it.
JavaFX isn't in Maven and, as a special bonus, has native deps. So, you'll need to unpack the JavaFX distribution somewhere and then do some setup whenever you play with Upshot:

    export JAVAFX_HOME="/Users/dave/Apps/javafx-sdk2.1.0-beta"
    source javafx.env.sh

    # do this only once. It installs JavaFX in your local maven repo.
    ./setup.sh
    lein deps

Now run the example (test/upshot/test/examples/example.clj)

    lein run -m upshot.test.examples.example

**Theading Note:** JavaFX is much pickier than Swing about code executing correctly on the JavaFX thread. So, most interactions at the REPL should be wrapped in the `(upshot.core/run-now)` macro.

### Running the Tests
I'm giving Midje a try:

    lein midje
